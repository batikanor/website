            <h3>How do I contact you?</h3>
            <p>I read all my E-Mails. Please send an E-Mail to <a href="mailto:batikanor@gmail.com">batikanor@gmail.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>What is this Webpage for?</h3>
            <p>
                This webpage is being built with the intention to organize all sorts of information I have. I'm hoping to fill these pages with notes from lessons, researchs, and maybe some other extra-matricular interests of mine. For now, here's a list of the pages that I've thought of:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a>: Brief explanation about the website</li>
                <li><a href="cv.html">CV</a>: (NOT DONE) Curriculum Vitae, I will summarize my accomplishments and add in some general information about myself, so that it may be a useful source for my future employers or so...</li>
                <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a>: (NOT DONE) I will categorize the projects that I've worked on and explain them with detail. I will also provide links for the sources that I've used while building the project, and I will probably still keep most of the code on github. </li>
                <li><a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>: (NOT DONE) This page will be like both a to-do list and a calendar, but I obviously won't write about all my plans in the future, I'll just share some of them.</li>
                <li><a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous</a>: (NOT DONE) I will aggregate all the content that I didn't or couldn't categorize on this website.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Who are you?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My full name is "Batıkan Bora Ormancı" ("ı" is a special turkish character, pronounced <em>'e' as in "folder"</em>)</li>
                <li>I'm 21 years old and currently studying Computer Engineering / Informatics at the <a href="http://tau.edu.tr/de">Turkish-German University</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why is the color scheme so disturbing on this webpage?</h3>
            <p>
                I find that color scheme quite motivating myself.
